                Yizkor is Hebrew for “remember”.

            In our efforts to revitalize and nurture the Jewish communities of the Former Soviet Union, very often we look back at those who have died; whether from natural causes, accidents or  barbaric acts of anti semitism – Jewish or friend of the Jewish Nation. This site is our way of  assuring they are never forgotten.

            Yizkor is the best way to honor the foundations our communities stand on.

            We invite you to honor your loved ones, ancestors, and friends through prayer and a meritorious deed in their honor.

            <div class="inPage_txt">
                <i>Yizkor</i>, in Hebrew, means “Remember.” It is not only the first word of the prayer, it also represents its overall theme. In this prayer, we implore G-d to remember the souls of our relatives and friends that have passed on.
            </div>
            <div class="inPage_txt">
            The prayer is recited 4 times during the Jewish calendar year.
            </div>
            <div class="inPage_txt">
            The main component of Yizkor is our private pledge to give charity following the holiday in honor of the deceased. By giving charity, we are performing a positive physical deed in this world, something that the departed can no longer do.

            The soul gains additional merit if the memory of its good deeds spur their loved ones to improve their ways.

            <div class="inPage_txt">
                Once you have filled out the short sign-up form with the name and date of death of the person you are honoring, as well as uploaded a high resolution photograph, you will automatically receive a confirmation email. We will then review the data and create a virtual plaque or grave stone on the Memory Wall.  
            </div>
            <div class="inPage_txt">
            On the sign-up form you will be asked if you would like to make a donation, as is the tradition for after reciting the Yizkor prayer in a synagogue. No donation is necessary for the plaque to be created and posted. However, any donation to our programs (which assist Jewish communities across the Former Soviet Union) is appreciated.
            </div>
            <div class="inPage_txt">
            Once the plaque has been created, you will be invited to share the image, along with a short description, on social media platforms. You will also be given a link to distribute via email to friends and relatives.
            </div>

            As the Western Wall is the most holy place in Jewish tradition today, we modeled our plaques  in the image of its stones. The image you see on our homepage is an award winning photograph of the Western Wall with its plaza filled to capacity with worshippers.
